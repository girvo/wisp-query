# wisp-query, a tiny dom library for wisp

Inspired by [zedshaw/jzed](https://github.com/zedshaw/jzed) and jQuery, but implemented in the [wisp language](https://github.com/Gozala/wisp/)

## Impemented

### Selection

- `$get` (though it acts more like $all, except returns a single Node if there is only one)
- `$id`
- `$filter`

## Todo

### Selection

- [ ] `$class`
- [ ] `$name`

And pretty much everything else!
